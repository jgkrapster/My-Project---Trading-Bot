OVERVIEW:
Built in Python, this project is an automated trading bot for MetaTrader 5 (MT5) that downloads historical and current prices, then analyzes using
the Supertrend indicator market trends and then proceeds to trade. MT5 bots are the focus of this project for trading XAUUSD (gold priced in USD) on 1-minute
timeframes. The strategy attempts to capitalize off the short-term trends of prices based on the Supertrend algorithm when action is given off on a breakout.

Educationally and developmentally, this trading bot is an embodiment of architecture of advanced algorithmic systems and facilitates flexible incorporation of risk measures, enhanced trade strategies, and compatibility of different securities.
